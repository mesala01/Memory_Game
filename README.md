# Memory_Game

Players will be shown a collection of cards, face down, and can click on a card to reveal whatâ€™s underneath.

After clicking on two cards, the game checks to see whether the cards match. If they do, they will remain facing up.

If not, the cards remain displayed to the player for one second, and then flip back down.

The goal of the game is to match up all the pairs in fewest clicks possible.
